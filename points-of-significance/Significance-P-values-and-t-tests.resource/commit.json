Many tests report the P value to measure the strength of the evidence that a result is not just a likely chance occurrence. To make informed judgments about the observations in a biological context, we must understand what the P value is telling us and how to interpret it. This month we will develop the concept of statistical significance and tests by introduc- ing the one-sample t-test. To help you understand how statistical testing works, consider the\nexperimental scenario depicted in Figure 1 of measuring protein expression level in a cell line with a western blot. Suppose we mea- sure an expression value of x = 12 and have good reason to believe (for example, from past measurements) that the reference level is m = 10 (Fig. 1a). What can we say about whether this difference is due to random chance? Statistical testing can answer this question. But first, we need to mathematically frame our intuitive understand- ing of the biological and technical factors that disperse our measure- ments across a range of values."]],[38,38],[1270,1270]]],[1533392430484,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,38,">"]],[38,38],[39,39]]],[1533392431270,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,39,"\n"]],[39,39],[40,40]]],[1533392431823,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,40,"\n"]],[40,40],[41,41]]],[1533392435777,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,39," "]],[39,39],[40,40]]],[1533392436897,["chenyl@btrspg",[[-1,39," "]],[40,40],[39,39]]],[1533392437995,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,39,"P "]],[39,39],[41,41]]],[1533392438421,["chenyl@btrspg",[[-1,40," "]],[41,41],[40,40]]],[1533392439592,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,40,"值"]],[40,40],[41,41]]],[1533392443402,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,39,"`"]],[39,39],[40,40]]],[1533392445589,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,42,"`，"]],[42,42],[44,44]]],[1533392446212,["chenyl@btrspg",[[-1,43,"，"]],[44,44],[43,43]]],[1533392473655,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,43,"表示的是概率上的显著，而不是生物雪上的"]],[43,43],[62,62]]],[1533392474477,["chenyl@btrspg",[[-1,59,"雪上的"]],[62,62],[59,59]]],[1533392476792,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,59,"学上的。"]],[59,59],[63,63]]],[1533392477876,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,65,"\n"]],[63,63],[64,64]]],[1533392478143,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,66,"\n"]],[64,64],[65,65]]],[1533392488474,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,65,">很多"]],[65,65],[68,68]]],[1533392565549,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,68,"科学家都会使用统计检验来确定一项"]],[68,68],[84,84]]],[1533392609133,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,84,"观测值是不是统计显著的。很多检验都会使用P值来测量"]],[84,84],[109,109]]],[1533392609495,["chenyl@btrspg",[[-1,107,"测量"]],[109,109],[107,107]]],[1533392618149,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,107,"作为一个结果是否"]],[107,107],[115,115]]],[1533392662997,["chenyl@btrspg",[[1,115,"偶然发生的一个测量度。"]],[115,115],[126,126]]],[1533392676512,["chenyl@btrspg",[[-1,128,"the P value reported by tests is a probabilistic significance, not a biological one.\nBench scientists often perform statistical tests to determine wheth- er an observation is statistically significant.
